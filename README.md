# Kundenbestellung_v6

This project is a customer order tracking and management system designed for efficient handling of customer orders. It features a modern, responsive frontend built with Tailwind CSS and a backend powered by Node.js and SQLite.

## Current State of the Project

- **Order Details Modal**: Clicking "Details anzeigen" opens a modal with detailed order information, including editable fields and order history.
- **Order Management**: Users can view, edit, and save changes to orders. Changes are tracked with a history log.
- **Backend API**: Provides endpoints for fetching orders, fetching individual order details, updating orders, and sending order emails.
- **Database**: Uses SQLite for storing orders and order history.
- **Mock Data**: Currently, the frontend uses mock data for demonstration purposes.
- **Styling**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern UI with responsive design.
